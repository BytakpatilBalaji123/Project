I developed a Voice-Based Language Translator Application using Python with a graphical user interface (GUI) built on Tkinter. The primary goal of the project was to enable real-time language translation using voice input and provide the translated output both textually and audibly.

 Key Features:
 Speech Recognition: Converts the user's voice input into text using the speech_recognition library.

 Language Translation: Translates the recognized text into the selected output language using googletrans.

Text-to-Speech Output: The translated text is spoken aloud using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).

User Interface: The GUI includes dropdowns to select input and output languages, buttons for recording and translation, and styled input/output text areas.

Technologies Used:
Python

Tkinter for GUI

SpeechRecognition for voice input

googletrans for language translation

gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for audio output

Pygame (optional) for playing the audio

Learning Outcomes:
Gained hands-on experience with Pythonâ€™s GUI programming and API integration.

Understood the working of speech-to-text and text-to-speech systems.

Learned about multilingual translation using cloud-based services.

Future Enhancements:
Add multi-language support in a single session.

Integrate with Streamlit for web-based deployment.

Improve UI aesthetics and responsiveness.

Add voice output language selection.
